# Transcript (Cleaned & Sectioned)

## Quick Index
- **What it covers:** End‑to‑end design system setup (tokens → components → publish).
- **Why it matters:** Establishes a full starter system, including Figma variable architecture and library publishing.
- **Key sections:** Token architecture, component framework, publishing/subscribing.

## 1) Intro — Rebuilt design system series
- The creator has rebuilt a multi‑episode design‑system series into one full video.
- Goal: **starter design system** with tokens + components + publishing workflow.

## 2) Token setup architecture
- Reiterates **three‑tier** (brand/alias/mapped) vs **two‑tier** (primitive/semantic).
- UI Collective uses the three‑tier model for scalability and multi‑brand needs.

## 3) Why people get tokens wrong
- Many creators adapt patterns without understanding the original use cases.
- The video emphasizes a **simple but correct** token setup to start.

## 4) Build the component framework
- Focus on foundational components and variants.
- Designed as a **starter system**, not an advanced, fully themed enterprise system.

## 5) Publishing a Figma library
- Publishing includes all component variants (including icons), which can take time.
- After publishing, teams can **subscribe** to the library via Figma “Libraries”.
- Figma shows only **changed components** on republish.

## 6) Subscription workflow
- Teams can subscribe to the design system library and receive updates.
- Republish flow highlights only updated components.

## 7) Wrap‑up
- The video ends with a complete starter DS: tokens, components, and publishing.
- Encourages further learning for advanced topics.

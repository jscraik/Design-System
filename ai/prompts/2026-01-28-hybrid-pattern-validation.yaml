- Title: Implement Hybrid Pattern Validation on UI Components

## Task
Implement the Hybrid Pattern validation (Option A) as per the DesignStudio migration plan:
- Implement compound API on 2-3 components (Button, Select, ChatInput)
- Validate spec's "props for 80%, compound for 20%" principle
- Measure code size impact

## Requirements
1. Add `variant="compound"` prop to Button, Select, and ChatInput components
2. Create compound sub-components (e.g., Button.Primary, Button.Secondary, Select.Trigger, etc.)
3. Use React Context for state sharing in compound mode
4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing props API
5. Run tests to verify all implementations work

## Context
- Following .spec/architecture-2026-01-26-design-studio.md migration plan
- Hybrid Pattern: "Props for 80%, compound for 20%"
- Components already use StatefulComponentProps from @design-studio/tokens

## Success Criteria
- All tests passing
- No breaking changes to existing props API
- Code size impact minimal (<1KB per component)
- TypeScript types correct
- Biome lint clean

## Additional Notes
After implementation, conduct adversarial review to find bugs and fix them.
